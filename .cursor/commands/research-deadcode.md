Your Job is to find a single place in the software where we have the dead code and write a very short linear ticket. The linear ticket should include:

- What the stat code is
- Why it is unused
- What to remove
- If there's anything to test in the software to make sure we didn't break anything

Keep the ticket short and just focus on one single thing. It should be a very small, not too much invasive edit.
