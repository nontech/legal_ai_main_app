Description:  
When a project planner requests a "TLDR," the agent must:
- Go to the specified part of the software and conduct a deep deep deep, comprehensive search.
- Provide a high-level technical summary that includes:
  - What this part encompasses (its purpose and boundaries)
  - How it connects to other software components (dependencies, interfaces, data flow)
  - An overview of the technical architecture (key classes, modules, services, patterns)
- Highlight the most important files or directories to review next for further technical insight.
- Ensure the TLDR is clear, actionable, and gives the planner a strong technical overview without unnecessary detail.
